## Mixed Integer Linear Optimal Pump Scheduling in Water Distribution Networks

This repository contains MATLAB/OCTAVE code for solving optimal pump
scheduling problem via approximatiom of a water distribution system
(pipes plus control elements) into piecewise-linear functions and formulation
of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which is then solved
by one of the MILP solvers.
