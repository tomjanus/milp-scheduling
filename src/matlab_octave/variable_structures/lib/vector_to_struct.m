function out = vector_to_struct(var_vector, var_struct)
  % Takes the variable vector (Nx1) and remaps it back to a
  % variable struct of a structure that was used in the first
  % place to produce the vector itself.
  % Args:
  %   var_vector - vector of variables constructed from a variable
  %      struct of the same `structure` to var_struct using
  %      `vector_to_struct` function.
  %   var_struct - variable structure used as a template and
  %      variable container (output).
